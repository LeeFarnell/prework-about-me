      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a 31 year old gay vegan, living in the West Midlands with my partner and our one eyed cat. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Birmingham, UK</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>When I am not working, I am usually playing video games. I am a huge fan of Nintendo and a lot of the games that they create including Pokemon, Legend of Zelda, Mario Bros, Animal Crossing, just to name a few. Along with this, I also have my own Twitch channel where I stream various games to a small but quite dedicated audience.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would probably to be a musician. It's a little cliche, but I've always loved music and have dabbled in songwriting and creating music in the past, and I'd love to be able to do that on a full time basis.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Birmingham in the UK. I was born and raised just outside the city in a town called Cannock, but I moved to the city for work back in 2016. Since 2017, I have been living with my longtime partner and our cat, named Katya.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always been interested in coding, and when I was a teenager, I used to run my own website which I also coded. A lot has changed since then, and as I got older, I didn't keep up my coding skills like I should of, and when the course came around, I thought it would be a great opportunity for me to learn again and make a career out of it. </p>
